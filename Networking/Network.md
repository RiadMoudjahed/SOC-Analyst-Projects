# WELCOME

In this project, I am going to show you how to make a lab and configure the network with VMware.

### Network Details

- **WAN:** `192.168.16.0/24` is the subnet IP of `VMnet8 > em0`, connecting the Virtual Machines and the host.  
- **pfSense:** `192.168.25.1` functions as a router and firewall, monitoring every device on the LAN.
- **Windows 10**, **Ubuntu**, and **Kali Linux** are all on the same LAN, connected through **pfSense**.  
- Note: These devices **will not have Internet access** unless **pfSense** is turned **ON**.
- **Linux Server** is connected to both LAN and WAN. Because we want to monitor our **host** using **Wazuh**.
