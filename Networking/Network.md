### Network Details

- **WAN:** `192.168.16.0/24` is the subnet IP of `VMnet8 > em0`, connecting the Virtual Machines and the host.  
- **pfSense:** `192.168.25.1` functions as a router and firewall, monitoring every device on the LAN.
- **Windows 10, Ubuntu, Kali Linux** are on the same LAN which are connected to **pfSense**.
