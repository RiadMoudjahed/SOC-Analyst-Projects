## üìò Overview

This project demonstrates a **basic vulnerability assessment** conducted in a **home lab environment** using **Tenable Nessus**. The goal was to identify, analyze, and interpret potential weaknesses within a simulated enterprise network, showcasing the essential workflow of a **Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst**.

## üß∞ Tools & Environment

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Host System** | Physical machine running VMware Workstation |
| **pfSense** | Acts as the network firewall/router |
| **Ubuntu Server** | Hosts Wazuh SIEM and Nessus scanner |
| **Windows 10 VM** | Simulated endpoint for user workstation |
| **Ubuntu Desktop VM** | Secondary endpoint |
| **Kali Linux VM** | Penetration testing and validation machine |

All systems were connected within an isolated virtual network, ensuring **ethical and controlled testing**.

## üß≠ Methodology

The assessment followed a structured approach similar to an enterprise vulnerability management cycle:

1. **Network Discovery**  
   - Scanned the local virtual network to identify all connected devices.

2. **Initial Vulnerability Scan**  
   - Performed a **Basic Network Scan** using **Nessus Essentials**.  
   - Configured targets: pfSense, Windows 10, Ubuntu, Kali, and host WAN interface.

3. **Results Visualization**  
   - Reviewed discovered hosts and their vulnerability counts in the Nessus dashboard.

4. **Filtering for Critical Findings**  
   - Applied filters to isolate **High** and **Critical** severity vulnerabilities.  
   - Prioritized remediation based on CVSS scores and exploitability.

5. **Exporting Results**  
   - Exported findings as a `.csv` file for detailed offline analysis and documentation.

6. **Vulnerability Analysis**  
   - Investigated specific CVEs affecting the systems.  
   - Mapped vulnerabilities to affected services.  
   - Suggested patching and configuration recommendations.

## üß© Key Insights

- Regular scanning identifies weaknesses before exploitation.  
- Prioritization by severity allows efficient patch management.  
- Exporting and analyzing results in CSV format supports SOC reporting workflows.  
- Tools like **Nessus** and **Wazuh** complement each other for detection and monitoring.

## üß† Conclusion

Through this lab, I successfully simulated a **vulnerability management process** within a controlled environment. The exercise strengthened my understanding of:

- **Asset discovery and enumeration**  
- **Vulnerability detection and prioritization**  
- **SOC-oriented analysis and reporting**

This project reflects my practical capability to **identify, assess, and communicate security risks**, aligning with SOC analyst core responsibilities.
