## üìò Overview

This project demonstrates a **basic vulnerability assessment** conducted in a **home lab environment** using **Tenable Nessus**. The goal was to identify, analyze, and interpret potential weaknesses within a simulated enterprise network, showcasing the essential workflow of a **Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst**.

---

## üß∞ Tools & Environment

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Host System** | Physical machine running VMware Workstation |
| **pfSense** | Acts as the network firewall/router |
| **Ubuntu Server** | Hosts Wazuh SIEM and Nessus scanner |
| **Windows 10 VM** | Simulated endpoint for user workstation |
| **Ubuntu Desktop VM** | Secondary endpoint |
| **Kali Linux VM** | Penetration testing and validation machine |

All systems were connected within an isolated virtual network, ensuring **ethical and controlled testing**.

## üß≠ Methodology

The assessment followed a structured approach similar to an enterprise vulnerability management cycle:

1. **Network Discovery**  
   - Scanned the local virtual network to identify all connected devices.

2. **Initial Vulnerability Scan**  
   - Performed a **Basic Network Scan** using **Nessus Essentials**.  
   - Configured targets: pfSense, Windows 10, Ubuntu, Kali, and host WAN interface.

3. **Results Visualization**  
   - Reviewed discovered hosts and their vulnerability counts in the Nessus dashboard.

4. **Filtering for Critical Findings**  
   - Applied filters to isolate **High** and **Critical** severity vulnerabilities.  
   - Prioritized remediation based on CVSS scores and exploitability.

5. **Exporting Results**  
   - Exported findings as a `.csv` file for detailed offline analysis and documentation.

6. **Vulnerability Analysis**  
   In this phase, I reviewed the **High** and **Critical** findings detected by Nessus to understand their **technical context**, **exploitability**, and **remediation paths**. Below is a summary of representative vulnerabilities discovered during the scan.

### üîπ Node.js Vulnerabilities

<img width="1786" height="418" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00562216-92a0-488e-864d-2076f0a98733" />


**Critical / High Severity ‚Äî Multiple CVEs (2024‚Äì2025)**  
Affected Versions: `< 18.19.1 / 20.11.1 / 21.6.2` to `< 18.20.6 / 20.18.2 / 22.13.1 / 23.6.1`  

**Key Issues Identified**
- Privilege escalation on Linux via environment variable handling  
- HTTP DoS via malformed chunked or HTTP/2 requests  
- Windows command injection and permission model bypasses  
- Diagnostic channel privilege escalation  
- Memory leaks causing resource exhaustion  

**Impact**
Attackers could escalate privileges, execute arbitrary code, or crash Node.js-based services.

**Remediation**
- Upgrade to **Node.js ‚â• 20.18.2 or ‚â• 22.13.1**  
- Apply principle of least privilege to system users  
- Use strict environment variable sanitization

### üîπ SSL Configuration ‚Äî SWEET32 (3DES Cipher Support)

<img width="1794" height="716" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98bb3b5e-9cbb-4e60-a819-0b40da285c4f" />

**Finding:** *SSL Medium Strength Cipher Suites Supported (SWEET32)* ‚Äî *High Severity*  
**Summary:** The system supports the outdated **3DES (Triple DES)** cipher suite  
`ECDHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA`, which is vulnerable to **birthday collision attacks** on 64-bit block ciphers.

**Impact**
Attackers could potentially recover plaintext data during long-lived HTTPS or VPN sessions.

**Remediation**
- Disable 3DES ciphers in all TLS configurations  
- Enable **TLS 1.2+ only**  
- Use modern cipher suites, e.g.:
  - `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`  
  - `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`

**Verification:** Retested with Nessus and SSL Labs to confirm 3DES removal.

| Component | Affected Versions | Vulnerability Type | Potential Impact | Severity |
|------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------|
| **GStreamer ‚ÄúBad‚Äù plugins** (USN-7558-1) | 20.04‚Äì25.04 | Buffer overflows in codec plugins | App crash or remote code execution | High |
| **FFmpeg** (USN-6803-1 / USN-6983-1) | 16.04‚Äì24.04 | Use-after-free, memory mismanagement | DoS or arbitrary code execution | High |
| **cJSON Library** (USN-6784-1) | 22.04‚Äì24.04 | Memory corruption in JSON parsing | App crashes or arbitrary code | High |
| **zvbi Library** (USN-7367-1) | 16.04‚Äì24.10 | Buffer parsing flaws | Application crash | High |

**Remediation**
- Apply all Ubuntu security updates (`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`)  
- Audit dependencies in multimedia applications using FFmpeg and GStreamer  
- Use only supported LTS packages when possible

### üîπ Summary of Analytical Insights

- Most **High and Critical** vulnerabilities stemmed from **outdated software** or **weak configurations**.  
- Proper patch management and cipher hardening significantly reduce attack surface.  
- Regular rescanning and correlation with **Wazuh SIEM** logs can confirm mitigation effectiveness.  
- This mirrors real SOC workflows: **Detection ‚Üí Prioritization ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Response ‚Üí Verification.**

## üß© Key Insights

- Regular scanning identifies weaknesses before exploitation.  
- Prioritization by severity allows efficient patch management.  
- Exporting and analyzing results in CSV format supports SOC reporting workflows.  
- Tools like **Nessus** and **Wazuh** complement each other for detection and monitoring.
