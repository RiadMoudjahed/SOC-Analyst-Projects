## What is NIST?

NIST is the **National Metrology Institute** for the United States, also known as an **NMI**. Everything you use in your everyday life works because of measurements. Without precise measurements, your car wouldnâ€™t run, your phone wouldnâ€™t work, and hospitals couldnâ€™t function. We maintain the measurements that make industry and society work.

## NIST Framework Implementation

### 1. IDENTIFY Phase
- **Asset:** Windows 10 Endpoint (Main-Win10, 192.168.16.1)
- **Monitored Directory:** C:\Users\Public\Documents
- **Detection Method:** Real-time File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
  <img width="1915" height="677" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2139a21-289a-434a-ad3f-fd4439f72946" />

### 2. PROTECT Phase
- **Controls Implemented:**
  - FIM with real-time monitoring enabled
  - SHA256/MD5 hash calculation on all files
  - Integration with VirusTotal threat intelligence
    <img width="1305" height="812" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c00fcd68-a852-4f81-843d-295c1b9a4feb" />

### 3. DETECT Phase
- **Detection Timeline:**
  - 08:08:21 - FIM detected file addition (Rule 554)
  - 08:08:21 - Custom EICAR rule triggered (Rule 100200, Level 12)
  - 08:08:24 - VirusTotal confirmed malicious (Rule 87105, 66/69 engines)
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD):** < 3 seconds
- **MITRE ATT&CK:** T1204 (User Execution)
  <img width="1914" height="902" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f2dcaf4-ebb5-4777-811f-d0b06b4ff8cb" />

### 4. RESPOND Phase
- **Automated Response:**
  - Critical alert generated (Level 12)
  - Email notification triggered
  - Threat intelligence enriched via VirusTotal
- **File Hash:** 44d88612fea8a8f36de82e1278abb02f (EICAR signature)
- **VirusTotal Report:** 66/69 AV engines flagged as malicious

### 5. RECOVER Phase
- **Remediation:** File identified and ready for quarantine/deletion
- **Documentation:** Complete incident timeline captured
- **Lessons Learned:** Detection pipeline validated successfully

## Technical Details

**File Information:**
- Path: `c:\users\public\documents\eicar.com`
- Size: 68 bytes
- MD5: 44d88612fea8a8f36de82e1278abb02f
- SHA256: 275a021bbfb6489e54d471899f7db9d1663fc695ec2fe2a2c4538aabf651fd0f

**Alert Sequence:**
1. Rule 553: File deleted (cleanup from previous test)
2. Rule 100200: EICAR custom detection
3. Rule 87105: VirusTotal malware confirmation
   
**The rule I Implemented:**
```
<group name="local,syscheck,">

  <!-- Simple EICAR detection based on filename -->
  <rule id="100200" level="12">
    <if_sid>550,554</if_sid>
    <field name="file">eicar</field>
    <description>EICAR test file detected: $(file)</description>
    <mitre>
      <id>T1204</id>
    </mitre>
  </rule>

</group>
```

## Key Metrics
- **Detection Rate:** 100% (3/3 alerts triggered)
- **False Positives:** 0
- **MTTD:** 3 seconds
- **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR):** < 10 seconds (automated)

  ## Methodology & Tools

### AI-Assisted Learning
This project was completed using AI (Claude) as a technical mentor and troubleshooting assistant. AI was used for:

- **Configuration guidance:** ossec.conf syntax, rule structure, integration setup
- **Debugging support:** Service failures, log analysis, error interpretation  
- **Best practices:** NIST framework alignment, MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- **Documentation templates:** Incident report structure, technical writing

### Hands-On Implementation
All infrastructure deployment, configuration, and testing was performed directly:
- Installed Wazuh Manager and Windows Agent
- Configured File Integrity Monitoring
- Created custom detection rules (Rule 100200)
- Integrated VirusTotal API
- Troubleshot and resolved service failures
- Validated detection with EICAR testing

### Skills Demonstrated
- SIEM deployment and configuration
- Linux system administration (systemctl, log analysis)
- Security event correlation and analysis
- API integration (VirusTotal)
- Incident detection and documentation
- Problem-solving and troubleshooting

## Conclusion
Successfully demonstrated end-to-end threat detection using Wazuh SIEM aligned with NIST SP 800-61 guidelines. Integration of custom detection rules and external threat intelligence (VirusTotal) provided comprehensive malware identification capabilities.
